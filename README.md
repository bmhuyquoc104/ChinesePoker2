## :star2: About the Project
### ðŸ’¡Introduction
Chinese Poker App is the application that made by Huy Vo to let the user get to know and enjoy this card game. Since this game is hard to get used to because of tons of combination and special rules for the beginner, thus, the rule of this app is simpler than the real Chinese Poker. The user can easily learn how to play by reading a rule with example in the rule view. Since this app comprises of 3 modes for user to play (Easy, Medium, Hard), thus the beginner will not get overwhelming when their first use it or the intermediate player can also increase their skill by choosing higher mode. To make the user feel more competitive, the leader board where the user can see all players money, achievements and how to earn that achievement is implemented. The user can also check their current money and achievement in the player profile view. Finally, before play the game, the user has permission to create new player or use old player that their created previously by typing the name.
